Nice to meet you, too. So, can you tell me about how you're running this place?

The last guy who owned this place kind of let it go. Got too excited about putting dragon heads on the walls. 

[[To be fair, dragons are cool|TutorialNode6]]
[[Is that what I was clearing out?|TutorialNode7]]
[[I tried to put my own spin on it|TutorialNode8]]

Oh, yeah, but you've still gotta have room for tables.

When a new person stumbles into town and immediately opens a tavern that serves drinks nobody has heard of, you get curious. 

[[Fair enough|TutorialNode12]]

So why don't you walk me through what you're doing. 

[[So, first thing is to look at the recipe|TutorialNode30]]

Once or twice. The last guy got a little too excited about hanging dragon heads on the wall.

And your recipe book comes up automatically when I order the drink, right?

[[Almost. It won't if I've made the drink before|TutorialNode18]]

Oh, okay. But then you can press TAB if you've made it before but need a reminder.

[[Exactly|TutorialNode19]]

What then?

[[Next I grab the glass|TutorialNode20]]

You grab the glass by hovering over it and clicking the LEFT MOUSE BUTTON, and put it down by clicking the RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON. 

[[That's right|TutorialNode28]]

Well, what changes it?

[[Whether the drink is shaken or stirred|TutorialNode22]]
===

Oh, so if the drink is stirred you put it in the glass, and if it's shaken then you put it in the shaker on the counter.

[[Exactly|TutorialNode23]]

It looks like you pick them up the same way, and then pour them in by hovering over the glass and pressing the LEFT MOUSE BUTTON.

[[You've got it|TutorialNode25]]

Must be difficult to keep thing organized, since it looks like you can put things down anywhere by pressing the RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON.

For my drink, it looks like you've got vodka, ginger beer, and lime. Once you put those in, do you select the bar spoon to stir?

[[Yes, it's a simple as that]]
